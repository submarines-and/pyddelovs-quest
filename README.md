# Pyddelovs Quest
You are a small, cold fox and the graphics are very confusing. Will you make it home to your den before it is too late?

## Building
`SDL2` is used for graphics, so this needs to be installed. I haven't looked into static linking, so the makefile will install them globally. If you run into permission issues, this is why.

```
make install
make build

```
